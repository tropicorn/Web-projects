/*Quang Nguyen jQuery project*/

3 Plug-ins used:

1. jQuery UI Autocomplete and Tabs
2. Avgrund plugin which acts like a window popup box when page is loaded
3. Nprogress bar that monitors the progress of when data is loaded and ready for certain element

The mainstyle.css are my own styles I used to customize the page (font, color, etc). I also added a gif background 
to the "title". When you hover over a piece of text inside, it imitates the flickering of a police siren, which 
indicates that this page is strictly used for emergency services.

Other css styles I kept mostly as it is, except for tabs and table pagination, which I changed certain colors to my likings.
Google Maps plugin also is doing what it's supposed to do. The content layouts are pretty straight forward for the
user to quickly find what they need.
